The exercise consists of developing a web page with a "Guess the number" game.

The game consists of the application generating a  random number between 1 to 100 and the player has to guess it. 

The game gives clues as if the number you try is too high or low and counts the number of attempts, until the player guess the number. 

It have a reset button to "Play again".




## Optimizations 🛠

Making a function that accepts a string as param and paints it into 'trackEl' instead to write many times "trackEl.innerHTML = 'something';" with JavaScript.
